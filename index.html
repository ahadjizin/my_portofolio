                    <span>But what about the roads?</span>
                    You just don't understand economics, like supply and demand. Don't worry kiddo, where there's a demand there will be a supply; we'll all have our roads.

                    <span>Is taxation theft?</span>
                    If I came to your house with some heavily armed buddies, demanded that you and your neighbors give me a percentage of your income, in return for some crappy monopolized services that you didn't ask for, would you consider that theft?

                    Libertarians want to live in a world where gay couples can protect their poppy fields with fully automatic weapons.

        A world where voluntaryism and property rights are treated with the highest respect.
