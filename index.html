        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello people. I dont have a lot to say or to show.</p>
        <p>I am 30 years old. I work in military aviaion on helicopters as an engineer. My work is to keep the 
            helicopters in service and my squadron active. I have the rank of a lietunant. I also have a master degree in Mechanical engineering and the licence for working in civil aviation.
        </p>
        <p>I tried several times to learn how to code. But i just know the basics of html css javascript and python.
            I dont quit. I will keep learning until i master them.
